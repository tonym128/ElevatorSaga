Here's my initial solution it can solve 1 - 11 but struggles on 6 and 10 quite a lot.

Hopefully I'll spend a bit of time coming up with a better solutions in the future, really enjoyed the game.

Basic idea is when a request comes in choose the least busy elevator based on queue.
If you're passing a floor that is in the queue, stop at it on the way and remove it.

Extenstions would be around taking the lift sizes into account and if there's a lot of lifts and a lot of floors 'dedicate' lifts to floors.
